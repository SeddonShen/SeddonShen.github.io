# About Me {#about-me}

I'm a Master's student at [Verification of System Software Group](https://versys.ios.ac.cn/) at the [Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.iscas.ac.cn) (ISCAS) and [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn) (UCAS), supervised by [Prof. Zhilin Wu](https://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~wuzl/). I previously earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology (Honors Program) from [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn) (NWPU) in 2023. 


My research interest includes Hardware Formal Verification and Large Language Models for Software Engineering.

#### GenshinCPU - Seven-Stage Pipelined MIPS Architecture Processor   <a href="https://github.com/gilgamsh/GenshinCPU" class="no-trailing-icon"><img alt="GitHub Repo stars" src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/gilgamsh/GenshinCPU?style=flat-square&logo=github&label=GitHub%20Stars&labelColor=black"></a> 
- üõ†Ô∏è Stack: Verilog/SystemVerilog, C/C++, FPGA | üìï[Report](files/GenshinCPU_designreport.pdf)
- A seven-stage single-issue processor based on the MIPS32 ISA, contains instruction and data cache, with a frequency of 145MHz, and can run PMON, Ucore, and Linux systems normally
- Built CI (Continuous Integration) and Verilator (Accelerated Compilation) infrastructure, saving 300 hours of local debugging time, designed and completed differential testing framework.
- Booted the Linux 2.6 kernel in 3 days, earning the National First Prize in the 5th Loongson Cup.

#### SQL-OJ Database Online Evaluation System 
- üõ†Ô∏è Stack: SQL, Django, JavaScript, Redis, Celery  |  üîó [Code](https://github.com/NPU-SQL-OJ/npu-sql-oj-django)
- Stack: SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python (Django)
- Developed an online SQL assessment platform for  teaching, supporting exams, exercises, and student management.
- Designed and implemented front-end (Bootstrap) and back-end (Django) systems with answer analysis.
- Optimized system performance for high concurrency using Redis, Celery, and message queue mechanisms.
- Awarded National Second Prize in the Chinese Collegiate Computing Competition; adopted as the official evaluation system for "Database Principles" at NWPU since 2022.

#### Intelligent Training Management Platform for Museum Volunteers
- üõ†Ô∏è Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP
- Combined with my personal experience of volunteering at Shaanxi History Museum, I developed a one-stop platform for recruitment, training, management, communication, and guarantee for the museum volunteer groups with a total of 2,000 users.
- Won the National Second Prize of China Collegiate Computer Computing Contest (WeChat Mini Program Track).
