# About Me {#about-me}

I'm a Masters Student at [Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.iscas.ac.cn) and [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn) under the supervision of [Prof. Zhilin Wu](https://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~wuzl/). Before that, He has obtained a Bachelor's degree of Computer Science from [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn) in 2023. 


My research interest includes Hardware Formal Verification and Large Language Models for Software Engineering.
